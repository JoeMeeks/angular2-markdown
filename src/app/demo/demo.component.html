    Angular 2 markdown Example

<div class="row">

        <pre>
            An h1 header
            ============

            Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

            2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
            look like:

            * this one
            * that one
            * the other one

            Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
            content starts at 4-columns in.

            > Block quotes are
            > written like so.
            >
            > They can span multiple paragraphs,
            > if you like.

            Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
            in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
            Unicode is supported. ☺
